# Toolchain Requirements

This project was developed and tested with the following tools and versions. For best compatibility and reproducibility, use these or newer versions:

- **Compiler:** Microchip XC-DSC v3.21  
  https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-xc-compilers

- **IDE:** MPLAB X IDE v6.15  
  https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-x-ide

- **Device Family Pack:** dsPIC30F v1.5.35 (or compatible)

- **Hardware:** dsPIC30F4011, 20 MHz crystal (or internal FRC oscillator as specified in each example)

## Additional Notes

- If using a different version of the compiler or IDE, verify that the configuration bits and peripheral libraries are compatible.
- All code examples use standard headers (`xc.h`, `libpic30.h`) included with XC-DSC.
- For USB or programmer/debugger support, install the latest Microchip drivers.
